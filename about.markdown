This blog is an attempt to keep up with my friends. In some ways, it is a start to knowing them more intimately. My vision is to create long-form dialogues that engages in personal and intellectual discourse. There isn't any real structure, but I write my essays in that spirit. I'm a fourth-year at Harvard, studying computer science and philosophy at Harvard. I teach children, do research, and code. In between some lines of code or prose, I do pullups and pushups, which is inspired by California inmates. When inmates got too big from working out, the state banned workout equipment. So they would do dips on bedframes, pullups, and pushups. They got huge.
