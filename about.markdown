**Daniel C. LaPointe** 

Hey folks. James and Sam roped me into this. I’m a junior at Harvard College with a concentration in mathematics and a secondary in psychology. Despite this path of study, I’ve always been a humanities sympathizer, hence the blog posts. In my spare time I enjoy hiking, playing piano, and talking politics with my high school friends. Fun facts? I don’t know. I sold my GME shares at $420.69, I guess. That was cool.

Topics I may write about in the future include: 

- The Rise and Fall of Harvard Memes for Elitist 1% Tweens
- Harvard Confessions and the STEM/Humanities Debate
- The Cult of Pure Math at Harvard
- Harambe and the Folk Religion of r/dankmemes
- 00’s Nostalgia
- r/LiminalSpace and Caretaker’s EATEOT
- Does Gen Z Have a Culture?

This blog is an attempt to keep up with my friends. In some ways, it is a start to knowing them more intimately. My vision is to create long-form dialogues that engages in personal and intellectual discourse. There isn't any real structure, but I write with my big picture in mind. 

I'm a fourth-year at Harvard, studying computer science and philosophy at Harvard. I teach, write, [do research](https://www.tarakmenon.com/spoken-words.html), and code. In between some lines of code or prose, I do pullups and pushups, which is inspired by California inmates. When inmates got too big from working out, the state banned workout equipment. So they would do dips on bedframes, pullups, and pushups. They got huge.
