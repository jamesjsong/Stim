**Daniel C. LaPointe** 

Hey folks. James and Sam roped me into this. I’m a junior at Harvard College with a concentration in mathematics and a secondary in psychology. Despite this path of study, I’ve always been a humanities sympathizer, hence the blog posts. In my spare time I enjoy hiking, playing piano, and talking politics with my high school friends. Fun facts? I don’t know. I sold my GME shares at $420.69, I guess.

Topics I may write about in the future include: 

- The Rise and Fall of Harvard Memes for Elitist 1% Tweens
- Harvard Confessions and the STEM/Humanities Debate
- The Cult of Pure Math at Harvard
- Harambe and the Folk Religion of r/dankmemes
- 00’s Nostalgia
- r/LiminalSpace and Caretaker’s EATEOT
- Does Gen Z Have a Culture?

**Samuel E. Puopolo** 

I was born on a humid day in August of 1997 in a world still transforming from analog to digital, back when there were still payphones, but nobody used them. I have tried my best to be a good person, but I have fallen short many times and been too lenient with my failings. I enjoy writing about religion, philosophy, poetry, and movies, but my dayjob is as a strategy consultant. I have a B.A. in Classics from Harvard and I enjoy reading Latin, Ancient Greek, (Old, Middle, Modern) English, (Old, Modern) French, (Middle, Modern) Welsh, Old Irish, Old Occitan, Old Norse, Italian, and I’m trying to learn Biblical Hebrew, Avestan, and Sanskrit.

This blog is an attempt to keep up with my friends. In some ways, it is a start to knowing them more intimately. My vision is to create long-form dialogues that engages in personal and intellectual discourse. There isn't any real structure, but I write with the big picture in mind. 

I'm a fourth-year at Harvard, studying computer science and philosophy at Harvard. I'm not a big fan of school. I teach to support myself, write to amuse myself and others, and [do research](https://www.tarakmenon.com/spoken-words.html) to do something cool. I am pretty aggressively independent-minded. I technically have a home, but I'm basically a nomad. Right now, I'm taking time off from school, and instead travelling.
